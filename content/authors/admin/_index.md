I am a first-year PhD student at [University of Chicago](https://cs.uchicago.edu), fortunately advised by prof [Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io). I finished my master study in CS at ETH Zurich. During the master's, I took a gap year at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com) working as an AI resident on LLMs and 3D computer vision. I was very fortunate to work with many talented folks and be supervised by [Barlas OÄŸuz](https://ai.meta.com/people/barlas-oguz), [Mike Lewis](https://ai.meta.com/people/mike-lewis), and [Gabriel Synnaeve](http://emotion.inrialpes.fr/people/synnaeve). Before the master's, I spent a year working on building search engines at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en) as a MLE. I graduated from NYU with honors in CS and was awarded with [Prize for Outstanding Performance in CS](https://cs.nyu.edu/dynamic/achievements/undergraduate).

With my previous works on *[CodeLlama](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12950)* and *[Llama 2 Long](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16039)*, I become very interested in AI systems, specially in developing efficient algorithms and systems for large-scale training and inference. I'm intrigued by how we could improve model alignment and understand the science behind these foundation models.
